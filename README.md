This pandemic has caused the world to exponentially advance the automation of processes. This is due to the danger of human contact. In an airport, there are still many points of contact, one of them being check-in. It is possible to check-in through mobile apps which will eliminate the contact through handling of IDs and shared touch screen devices. However, the baggage must still be processed by an assistant. Our app will take this process to the next level by implementing a system of checking in bags without human interaction.

Instead of checking in baggage with an assistant at a kiosk, the app will allow us to automate the baggage check-in process. We will achieve this by having a screen with a QR code beside the scale, and QR scanning capability within the app. Once the QR code is scanned the check-in process will be completable via the use of the individuals personal cell phone.
The two MC APIâ€™s that we have integrated into the app are the Click to Pay, (which is activated in the instance the user has overweight baggage, or would like to purchase additional baggage), and the ID assist which will verify the identity of the user to further secure the payment.

We have accounted for most of the potential outcomes, which include, overweight baggage, additional baggage, tampering with baggage after its weigh-in, etc.
